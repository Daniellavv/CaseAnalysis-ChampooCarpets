In this analysis, I am going to assess the main factors that are driving the high costs, as well as analyze the activity of the major clients. Finally I am going to provide a series of recommendations directed to Champoo managers.

Champo Carpets is one of the major carpet manufacturing carpets in India, with more than 52 years of experience. However, they are facing a decrease in their sells, due to a low conversion rate (rate between samples and selling orders).
